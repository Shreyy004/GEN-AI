Headquartered in Mumbai, it is a part of the Tata Group and operates in 150 locations across 46 countries. As of 2024, Tata Sons owned 71.74% of TCS, and close to 80% of Tata Sons\\' dividend income came from TCS.\\nIn September 2021, TCS recorded a market capitalization of US$200 billion, becoming the first Indian IT company to achieve this valuation. In 2012, it was the world\\'s second-largest user of U.S. H-1B visas.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1968–2000 ===\\n\\nTata Consultancy Services Limited, originally known as Tata Computer Systems, was established in 1968 by Tata Sons Limited. The company\\'s initial contracts involved providing punched card services to its sister company TISCO (now Tata Steel), developing an Inter-Branch Reconciliation System for the Central Bank of India, and offering bureau services to the Unit Trust of India.\\nIn 1975, TCS implemented an electronic depository and trading system named SECOM for Swiss company SIS SegaInterSettle. It also developed System X for the Canadian Depository System and automated the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. TCS also partnered with the Swiss firm TKS Teknosoft, which it later acquired.\\nIn 1980, TCS established India\\'s first dedicated software research and development center, the Tata Research Development and Design Centre (TRDDC), located in Pune. The following year, it created India\\'s first client-dedicated offshore development centre, established for Tandem.\\nAnticipating the Y2K bug and the introduction of the unified European currency (Euro), Tata Consultancy Services developed a factory model for Y2K conversion. The company also created software tools to automate the conversion process and facilitate implementation by third-party developers and clients. In late 1999, TCS introduced Decision Support System (DSS) solutions to the domestic market. In 1999, the company also registered its first tagline, \"Beyond the Obvious.\"\\n\\n\\n=== 2001–2019 ===\\n\\nIn 2001, TCS entered the bioinformatics segment, and three years later, launched India\\'s first bioinformatics product.\\nIn 2003, TCS became the first Indian IT company to record $1 billion in revenue. On 25 August 2004, TCS became a publicly listed company after its initial public offering.\\nIn July 2005, Tata Infotech, which was until then a different IT subsidiary of Tata Sons, merged with TCS in a stock swap deal. Later that year, TCS changed its tagline from \"Beyond the Obvious\" to \"Experience Certainty\".\\nIn 2006, TCS developed an ERP system for the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation. By 2008, its e-business operations were generating over US$500 million in annual revenue.\\nIn 2011, TCS entered the small and medium enterprises market with cloud-based solutions. On the final trading day of 2011, it surpassed RIL to achieve the highest market capitalization of any India-based company. In the 2011–12 fiscal year, TCS achieved annual revenues exceeding US$10 billion for the first time.\\nIn May 2013, TCS was awarded a six-year contract valued at over ₹11 billion (US$130 million) to provide services to the Indian Department of Posts. In 2013, the company moved from 13th to 10th place on the list of global IT services companies by revenue. In July 2014, it became the first Indian company to exceed ₹5 trillion (US$81.93 billion) in market capitalization.\\nIn January 2015, TCS became India\\'s most profitable company, ending Reliance Industries Limited\\'s 23-year streak.\\nIn January 2017, TCS announced a partnership with Aurus, a payments technology company, to deliver payment solutions for retailers through TCS OmniStore, a pioneering unified store commerce platform. The same year, TCS China entered into a joint venture with the Chinese government.\\nIn March 2018, Tata Sons sold TCS shares worth $1.25 billion in a bulk transaction.\\nIn 2019, TCS received four Stevies at the American Business Awards.\\n\\n\\n=== 20')]\n"
